# BeaverHack2018

This is the repository for the Oregon State University's Fall 2018 Hackathon held September 2018.  

## Background 
Our team is designing this project as a way to offer an additional tool to busy educators who have students in need of quick visual references. Bilingual teachers especially need to be able to visually display the meaning of words to English Language Learners. This population of student needs targeted support in the areas of language that they are not familiar when learning a second or third language.

## Objectives
Scan documents for nouns or verbs.
Search the internet for images that the words represent.
Create a link to the word with the image. 
When the link is clicked, the small window opens with the image.

## Scope 
This project will be a tool for teachers to quickly get images of the object or action that different words used in a lesson text represent. After opening the document, the document will contain links with the words that, when clicked, will open a smaller window containing an image showing what the word represents.
